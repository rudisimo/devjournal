Here we are again.

Thanks to an influx of survival base building games[^1], access to higher quality tools[^2], and a somewhat depressing day job[^3]; I think there is no better time to revisit the dream.

So, what is the type of game I want to build? Easy, an **Open World Survival Crafting** game in **Space**. Quite a mouthful and niche genre, but coincidently a lot of the games I love fall neatly within that category.

The next post will be a deep dive into what I find compelling and off-putting about each of the games below.
