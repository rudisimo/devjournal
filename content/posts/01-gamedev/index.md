The thought of designing and building games has been on my head for well over two decades now. It started originally as a daydream of wanting to work for a game company like Valve.

The game idea that keeps coming back to my mind which is to build an open-world building/survival game Ã 'la [{{< icon "steam" >}} Satisfactory](https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/), but with none of the weird bugs :grinning_face_with_sweat:.

In the meantime I will continue playing and daydreaming.

The following concepts are from my research of [{{< icon "steam" >}} Subnautica](https://store.steampowered.com/app/264710/Subnautica/).

### Minutes of Fun

- **5 minutes**
Listen to music at the main menu
- **20 minutes**
Swim to explore one biome, collect some loot
- **40 minutes**
Start on an immobile raft with a fabricator. Swim to collect loot, craft a dive knife. Use dive knife to harvest kelp.
- **1 hour**
Now raft looks like a sub and you can drive it. Use it to explore new biome to get Tier 2 loot. Use new loot to craft submersible vehicle.
- **2 hours**
See creatures swimming around, harvest narwhal horn, submarine can flood, can craft welder to fix leaks. Now you can plant harvested kelp to add O2 to submarine.

### Multi-Linear Storytelling

- Trigger initial quests randomly (random timer)
- Trigger quests as milestones are reached (reach location, discover tech, etc.)
